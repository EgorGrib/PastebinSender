# PastebinSender
A simple plugin for IntelliJ IDEA with which you can easily send the selected code to [pastebin.com](https://pastebin.com/)<br/>
Used for development auto build system Gradle and IntelliJ Platform Plugin SDK.<br/>Configuring and sending paste is done with [java pastebin API](https://github.com/marcoacierno/pastebin-java-api).

## Getting started
Go to the [release page](https://github.com/EgorGrib/PastebinSender/releases) to download the jar file.<br/>
Add the plugin from IntelliJ IDEA using "Install Plugin from Disk..." button in settings>Plugins.

## How to use
1. Select the code which you want to share and send to Pastebin.com
2. Use the keyboard shortcut "Ctrl + \\" to send the code and get the link.

## Difficulties that I faced
When I was developing this plugin, I created too many pastes and I no longer have the ability to create new ones. It turns out there is a limit of only 10 pastes in 24 hours.
